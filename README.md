# 🌤️ Weather Image Classification
A deep learning project built with Keras to classify weather images into four distinct categories: Cloudy, Rain, Shine, and Sunrise.

# 📋 Project Overview
This project implements a sophisticated image classification system that automatically identifies weather conditions from images using deep learning techniques. The model leverages transfer learning with VGG16 architecture and advanced data augmentation to achieve high accuracy in weather classification.

# 🎯 Features
Multi-class Classification: Classifies images into 4 weather conditions

Transfer Learning: Utilizes pre-trained VGG16 model for enhanced performance

Data Augmentation: Implements advanced image augmentation techniques

Keras Implementation: Clean and modular code using Keras framework

High Accuracy: Achieves reliable classification results
